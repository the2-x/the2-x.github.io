    <main>
      <p>The Project has 4 channels, wherein I try to showcase the best of 2 factions, to increase mutual-appreciation, expand mutual-understanding, and maybe make this world a little better by such efforts:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@the2-XPatriot"><cite>The 2-X Patriot</cite></a>
        <p>This channel is supposed to share interesting and/or useful information on by 2 home-countries: 🇵🇭 the Republic of the Philippines (my birthplace) & 🇺🇸 the United States of America (my adopted home). For anyone in <abbr title="the Republic of the Philippines">the Republic</abbr> and/or <abbr title="the United States of America">the Union</abbr>, considering being anywhere there, or just interested in those jurisdictions, this might prove interesting for you. See the good & bad, triumphs & on-going issues, the best & the worst, from both sides of the Pacific!</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@the2-XFaithful"><cite>The 2-X Faithful</cite></a>
        <p>In this channel, be guided with the wisdom across Jewish & Christian (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) traditions. Compare interpretations, be assured by commonalities, see the intricacies of differences (in focus, considerations, implications, <abbr>etc.</abbr>), and and find trends. Discover and appreciate each other's music, better understand each others histories & cultures. There's much to learn & appreciate!</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@the2-XEasternWesterner"><cite>The 2-X Eastern Westerner</cite></a>
        <p>There are SO MANY cool things from the East & the West, it's often taken for granted. And some are only known in 1 side, while practically unheard-of in the other. Let's bridge that gap, and enjoy the best of both worlds!</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@the2-XFactoidsMore"><cite>The 2-X Factoids & More</cite></a>
        <p>For things that don't fit in any of these categories (PLUS administrative thigns for THE ENTIRE SERIES), this channel is to be the central-hub of the series (on the YouTube™-website, at least)</p></li>
      </ul></p>

    <p>Have any cool factoids or useful tips not mentioned here? Or do any of the listed require some yet-undone updates or corrections? (OR did any of these options work… or NOT work for you?)
      <br>Please, contact me via 𝕏 (<a href="https://x.com/2XFactoidsMore" tabindex="02">@2XFactoidsMore</a>) or <abbr title="electronic mail">e-mail</abbr> (<a href="mailto:the.2-x@use.startmail.com" tabindex="03">med_cost-cutting@use.startmail.com</a>)!
      <br>Let's learn together, share useful info, and create an ever-improving listing that helps EVERYONE!</p>
    <p>DISCLAIMER: This is NOT professional advice. I am just a high-functioning autistic info-junkie with an amateur research & data-aggregation hobby, as well as a desire to help people.
      <br>I CAN BE WRONG, so please also DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, to be safe. I try my best to avoid mistakes, but I am human.
      <br>Hence, I welcome any constructive info that can help improve the listing.</p>
