    <main>
      While the <abbr title="United States (of America)">U.S.</abbr> is generally regarded as a 2-party system, (in reality) there are WAY more than only 2. (And these are just the parties I've detected so far. This listing will be updated accordingly.) Given <a href="https://nolabels.org">No Labels®</a>'s non-party status (as far as I can determine, as of yet), I've not added it to the list.
