    <main>
      <p>Hello, fellow <span lang="ja-JP">おたく</span> ("<span lang="ja-JP" class="itaalic">otaku</span>")!!! Here is a suite of Japanese lessons (even in-person classes!), brought to you by the Japanese taxpayer! That's right: Japan WANTS YOU to learn their language, enough to pay for your classes! So, let's give them a return on their investment: Let's study their language, enjoy the best of their culture, buy their stuff, and tour their awesome nation!
        <br class="italic">Note: The last is NOT taxpayer-funded, but is HIGHLY useful, so I'm listing it, too!

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/">either more-purely</a> ①grammar lessons (the <time datetime="2015">2015</time>-edition, offered in 17 languages) or ②conversation lessons (the newer, in 20 languages)</li>
          <li>what seems to be ③<a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/learnjapanese/">a mix of both</a></li>
        </ul>
