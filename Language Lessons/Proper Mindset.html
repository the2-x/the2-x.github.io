            <p>Granted, the target-language in these videos is English, but (truthfully) it applies to ALL languages, too! As explained by the Japanese co-host of the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RachelandJun" tabindex="01">@RachelandJun</a>"=<a href="https://www.youtube.com" tabindex="02">YouTube</a>™ channel (in a monologue for helping his fellow-Japanese who wish to improve their English-skills), these 3 vidoes explain how to really get the most of your languge-learning:

                      <p><strong>WHY are you studying that language?</strong> Unless/Until you clarify your purpose(s) of your efforts, your efforts will also tend to be vague, scattered, and (likely) wasted. Some purposes Jun mentioned were…
                        <ul>
                          <li>Academics: improving grades, passing tests, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></li>
                          <li>Livelihood: improving job-hunting chances, fulfilling new job-functions, <abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                          <li>Traveling: communicating with locals while in the relevant jurisdiction(s)</li>
                          <li>Relationship-Building: dingind potential-spouses, making friends, <abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                          <li><abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>Based on your defined objective(s), what type(s) the target-language are you aiming to master?</strong> For example: If you're aiming to make sense of laws & court-decisions, will it make more sense to focus on legalese in police-reports, on Medieval-era literary classics, or on slang in the latest-released series & movies?</p>

                    <p><strong>Don't force yourself to study the language.</strong> Keep it fun, relaxed, and enjoyable. WHat good are your efforts if you quit altogether?</p>
                    <p><strong>Try to communicate with native-speakers.</strong> Getting used to the input & output is important, and (if mutually-onjoyed topics are discussed) the fun & learning will be mutual.</p>

                  <p><strong>Use Jun's "This is a pen."-pracice.</strong> Yes, you can make sentences in your head, but can you SAY it like a native, smoothly & in realtime? Start with very simple sentences, and make variations. Eventually, make them longer and/or more complex.</p>
                  <p><strong>Remember: Language isn't just an academic subject, but a TOOL for everyday-use.</strong> Make it second-nature to you by actuallyusing it in normal, everyday life.</p>
                  <p><strong>Make a native-speaking friend.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Record yourself speaking the target-language(s).</strong> Are your pronunciation, accent, intonation, <abbr>etc.</abbr> right?</p>
                  <p><strong>Talk to yourself in the target-language(s).</strong></p>

            <summary><strong><cite>Forvo</cite>, THE Multi-Lingual Pronunciation-Dictionary</strong></summary>
            <p>Uncertain how to pronounce a word in your target-language(s)? Forvo Media, <abbr title="Sociedad Limitada">S.L.</abbr>'s "<a href="https://forvo.com/"><strong><cite>Forvo</cite></strong></a>"-website is a vital help, then! Just type-in the word, and see the pronunciation-entries of native-speaking volunteers across the globe! It's especially useful with more global languages, with many dialects and/or national-standards.</p>

            <summary><strong>Additional Language-Classes (for Filipinos)</strong></summary>
            <p>Considering the great number of Overseas Filipino Workers (<abbr title="Overseas Filipino Workers">O.F.W.'s</abbr>) & their contribution to the economy, Manila supports the training of Filipinos in foreign-languages, to the point of offering <a href="https://www.tesda.gov.ph/About/TESDA/39" tabindex="03"><strong>taxpayer-funed lessons</strong></a> via Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (<abbr title="the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority"><a href="https://www.tesda.gov.ph" tabindex="04">T.E.S.D.A.</a></abbr>) under Department of Labor & Employment (<abbr title="the Department of Labor & Employment"><a href="https://dole.gov.ph/" tabindex="05">D.O.L.E.</a></abbr>).
              <br>I'm not aware of counter-part classes in other governments. (If you know any, let me know, so I can add them here, too!) If/When I discover other sources, I'll add them here as well.</p>
