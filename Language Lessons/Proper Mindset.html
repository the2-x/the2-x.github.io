        <p>Granted, the target-language in these videos is English, but (truthfully) it applies to ALL languages, too! As explained by the Japanese co-host of the "<a href="https://rachelandjun/">@RachelandJun</a>"=YouTube™ channel (in a monologue for helping his fellow-Japanese who wish to improve their English-skills), these 3 vidoes explain how to really get the most of your languge-learning:

                <p><strong>WHY are you studying that language?</strong> Unless/Until you clarify your purpose(s) of your efforts, your efforts will also tend to be vague, scattered, and (likely) wasted. Some purposes Jun mentioned were…
                  <ul>
                    <li>Academics: improving grades, passing tests, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></li>
                    <li>Livelihood: improving job-hunting chances, fulfilling new job-functions, <abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                    <li>Traveling: communicating with locals while in the relevant jurisdiction(s)</li>
                    <li>Relationship-Building: dingind potential-spouses, making friends, <abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                    <li><abbr>etc.</abbr></li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>><strong>Based on your defined objective(s), what type(s) the target-language are you aiming to master?</strong> For example: If you're aiming to make sense of laws & court-decisions, will it make more sense to focus on legalese in police-reports, on Medieval-era literary classics, or on slang in the latest-released series & movies?</p>

                <p><strong>Don't force yourself to study the language.</strong> Keep it fun, relaxed, and enjoyable. WHat good are your efforts if you quit altogether?</p>
                <p><strong>Try to communicate with native-speakers.</strong> Getting used to the input & output is important, and (if mutually-onjoyed topics are discussed) the fun & learning will be mutual.</p>

              <p><strong>Use Jun's "This is a pen."-pracice.</strong> Yes, you can make sentences in your head, but can you SAY it like a native, smoothly & in realtime? Start with very simple sentences, and make variations. Eventually, make them longer and/or more complex.</p>
              <p><strong>Remember: Language isn't just an academic subject, but a TOOL for everyday-use.</strong> Make it second-nature to you by actuallyusing it in normal, everyday life.</p>
              <p><strong>Make a native-speaking friend.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Record yourself speaking the target-language(s).</strong> Are your pronunciation, accent, intonation, <abbr>etc.</abbr> right?</p>
              <p><strong>Talk to yourself in the target-language(s).</strong></p>
